	Key Concepts:
	Pointers: A pointer holds the memory address of a value. They are declared with an asterisk (*) to denote a pointer type.
	Address of Operator (&): This operator is used to get the memory address of a variable.
	Dereferencing Operator (*): This operator is used to access the value at the memory address stored in the pointer.
